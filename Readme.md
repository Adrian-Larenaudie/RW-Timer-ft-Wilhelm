### To practice JS vanilla, I made this timer app

**Quick description:**
- code organization with js modules 
- configurable timer  
- ability to pause
- RetroWave design
- grid style strongly inspired from: https://codepen.io/hugo/pen/eYZrOW 
- sun style obtained from: https://codepen.io/Sorskoot/pen/qBWpRea 
- responsive design
- Wilhelm's cry to indicate the end of the timer ^^

**Area for improvement**
- repeatedly clicking on the pause button leads to a bug in the application
- refresh the page decenters main element (true with google chrome, not with Mozilla)
